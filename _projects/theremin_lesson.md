Hand built, early electronic circuitry powers spinning sirens, rotating loudspeakers, mechanical arms and machines. A complex system of electronic noise machines and devices brings the vast empty top floor of the mill to life with humming, crackling, whirring electronic noises and sirens.

The work emerged out of a research process based at Masson Mill, Matlock, Derbyshire. The spinning of the rotating arms reflects the 'spinning' of the industrial textile machines in the former textile mill known locally as 'Arkwright's New Mill'.
