**Description:**

A series of giant towers hold suspended bell-like speaker cones. A team of ‘bell-ringers’ start to operate the industrial machinery and make the pendulum arms swing to and fro, gradually swinging higher and higher until each arm soars up over the heads of the audience ringing forth with a peel of electronic tones that combine into a transfixing harmony of pulsing drones.

*Ring Out* continues Ray Lee’s distinctive combination of sound and kinetic sculpture that pushes at the boundaries of street art by bringing high quality contemporary composition into the public realm.

*Ring Out* has been commissioned by OCM and has received a PRS New Music Biennial award and Arts Council England support with performances scheduled for Hull (City of Culture) and at London South Bank, and will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3. The work has been developed at the Corn Exchange’s 101 Outdoor Art Creation Space at Greenham Common.
