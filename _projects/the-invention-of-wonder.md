Ten sonic experiments create a theatre of the unexplained by the master alchemist of sound, Ray Lee.

> *Is it the light that makes the sound or the sound that makes the light?*
>
> *Planet-like orbs float in mid-air, objects move of their own volition and hum with electronic noise.*
>
> *Invisible-forces and ethereal sounds collide as you question your perception - is that the sound of the universe laughing?*

Somewhere between an Enlightenment lecture on natural philosophy, a Victorian illusion and a performance of electronic music, the Invention of Wonder is an exploration of invisible forces made tangible, audible and physical. The sonic ‘evidence’ is used to create a compelling and mesmerising sound composition that may rekindle some of our lost wonder in ‘natural magic’ and the marvellous.

This new music-theatre performance by internationally acclaimed sound artist Ray Lee takes as one of its starting points the Philosophical Table, a table used to set up and demonstrate the new discoveries of science, or what was then known as Natural Philosophy, during the Enlightenment. The original Philosophical Table is exhibited in the Science Museum in London and Ray has created a purpose built sonic ‘philosophical table’ which he uses to generate sound through a series of ten electro-magnetic sculptural and sonic experiments.

> *“This idea has been in my mind for over seventeen years, ever since I came across this table while visiting the science museum. I imagined a ‘sonic’ philosophical table where I set up and present sonic experiments and following this long gestation period I presented the premiere of the new work, complete with my own sonic philosophical table, at the Holywell Music Room as part of IF Festival Oxford in Autumn 2024 and presented by OCM.” Ray Lee*

[The Philosophical Table](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co1815/george-iiis-philosophical-table-philosophical-tables){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was a purpose made table used for public demonstrations of scientific phenomena. Experiments were set up and demonstrated on the tabletop, presenting the new scientific discoveries of the Enlightenment to the educated classes in late eighteenth century society. Lecturers such as Stephen Demainbray, Erasmus King and Benjamin Martin presented classes and lectures in the new science in London during the late eighteenth century and started a fashion for the popularisation of science that exists to this day.
