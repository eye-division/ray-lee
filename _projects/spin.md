'Spin', Sensitive Skin season of new performance. Future Factory Nottingham. 2001

'Spin' develops and extends the research work begun in 'The Theremin Lesson'. In 'Spin', the machines and devices developed in the research process at Masson Mill are reworked for a contemporary art gallery space. The performance aimed to evoke the sense of industrial processes, the latent obsolescence of technology and the invisible forces of magnetism and electro-magnetic fields.
