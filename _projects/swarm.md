Swarm is a kinetic sound work designed for atrium spaces consisting of a series of suspended motors from each of which are hung three loudspeakers. As the motors rotate the loudspeakers are swung out by centrifugal force and emit stored sounds above the heads of the audience. Originally commissioned by Muziek Centrum Nederland it was recomposed for FACT, Liverpool 2008.

> 'Storing up digital information, they are set in motion at regular intervals, unleashing a sweet, sonic shower of Ambient electronica that hums volumes about the quiet joy of this location.' The Wire

**Swarm Version 1** was installed in the atrium of the Amsterdam Muziekgebouw. Ten suspended 'swarm units' were hung throughout the space and were activated by the presence of people walking underneath. The sounds activated were based on the sound world of 'Siren' creating a choir of spinning drones filling the atrium with a constantly changing texture of pulsing sound.

**Swarm Version 2** was installed in the atrium of FACT in Liverpool. Five units were suspended and this time the work was computer controlled with motors being activated at different times during the opening hours of the building. The sounds were activated by the rotation of the arms and triggered a series of digital sound stores which replayed samples of sound composed specially for the location. Inspired by the sound of bees and insects humming in trees, the intention was to create a swirling, throbbing hum of electromagnetic sound and noise that ebbed and flowed continuously.

Working with electronics expert Graham Calvert, Ray Lee devised a system of charging the sound storeâ€™s batteries through electro-magnetic induction; a system of induction coils being used to pass the current across the gap between the coils to alleviate any need for a commutator.
