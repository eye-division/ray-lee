Force field is a 30 minute performance for MIDI Theremin and sound machines. By interacting with the electro-magnetic ‘force field’ that surrounds the Theremin, Lee activates and controls a series of kinetic sound machines creating music and movement from the Ether.

Somewhere between a Victorian illusion, a performance of electronic music and a scientific demonstration, Force field is an exploration of invisible forces made tangible, audible and physical.

Force field won an Honorary Mention at the 2008 Prix Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria.

2007 ‘Force field’ ICA, London. 2 performances.

2008 ‘Force field’ Science Gallery, Dublin. 2 Performances

2008 ‘Force field’ Bishopsgate Institute, London.
