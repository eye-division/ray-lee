Force field is a 30 minute performance for MIDI Theremin and sound machines. By interacting with the electro-magnetic ‘force field’ that surrounds the Theremin, Lee activates and controls a series of kinetic sound machines creating music and movement from the Ether.

Somewhere between a Victorian illusion, a performance of electronic music and a scientific demonstration, Force field is an exploration of invisible forces made tangible, audible and physical.

Force field won an Honorary Mention at the 2008 Prix Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria.
