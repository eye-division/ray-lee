Just how much do you know about electricity?

Join ‘Professor Lee’ for a short conversation about the nature of the hidden force that drives our technologically intense lives. Feel the force. Become one with the electrons. In the safe hands of ‘Professor Lee’ you will experience, if you so chose, a mild electric shock, completely safe, of course….. By holding hands we will make a circuit. Our bodies become capacitors and the electricity passes through us. You can’t see electricity, but you can feel it.
