> Join ‘Professor Lee’ for a short conversation about the nature of the hidden force that drives our technologically intense lives. Feel the force. Become one with the electrons. In the safe hands of ‘Professor Lee’ you will experience, if you so chose, a mild electric shock, completely safe, of course….. By holding hands we will make a circuit. Our bodies become capacitors and the electricity passes through us. You can’t see electricity, but you can feel it.

*Electric* was made for Battersea Arts Centre’s first One-on-One Festival, a festival of short performances for one audience member at a time. Set in a disused office space at the rear of the building *Electric* took the form of a five consultation with ‘Professor Lee’. During this consultation the performer and the audience member would have a discussion about the nature of electricity before being offered to share a low voltage and low power electric shock by creating a circuit between the electric shock machine and the performer. The piece was performed over two hundred times during the festival.

**Technical:**

The electric shock was provided by a vintage shocking coil running off 3v DC with a current of no more than one or two milliamps. The electric shock was a continuous back current creating a distinctive tingling sensation rather than a spike caused by build up of voltage in a capacitor for example. All participants were aware of the nature of the work before entering and taking part. All audience members were asked if they had epilepsy and or a pace maker.
