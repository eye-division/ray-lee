Shadow Me, a seven minute long animated movie with music by composer Pia Silvi.

The film developed out of a series of shadow drawings created to explore the more immediate engagement a viewer feels when there's a hint of narrative in an art work. Exactly what the narrative is remains unclear, but while working on the drawings, I came across Adalbert von Chamisso's 1814 fable of Peter Schlemihl, The Man Who Sold His Shadow (Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte).
