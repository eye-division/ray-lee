> Utterly wonderful<br>Sumit Paul-Choudhury, editor New Scientist magazine

Enter the *Ethometric Museum* and be transported into a parallel universe of cosmic tones and esoteric technology, an Aladdin’s cave of exquisitely hand- crafted contraptions.

Inside you will bathe in the resonant sound waves generated by the spinning machines and dancing automata and marvel as Professor Lee flicks the knobs and tunes the dials to play an innovative musical soundscape that envelops you like a ‘three dimensional piece by Steve Reich’.

According to the introduction given to you by the earnest and elegantly dressed curator, Dr. Kounadea, each machine emits specific harmonic frequencies and through their precise manipulation Ethometrics ‘expert’ Professor Lee will realign your ‘super-electrical field’.

Appearing to be artefacts from a hitherto unknown branch of science, these extraordinary Ethometric Instruments are curious, fascinating and beguiling relics from a bygone age. Fascinating, compelling and hauntingly beautiful, *Ethometric Museum* is an immersive theatrical journey into a hypnotic and mesmerising world of whirling devices, pulsing drones and proper science.
