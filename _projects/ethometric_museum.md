Appearing to be artefacts from a hitherto unknown branch of science, Ethometric Instruments are curious, fascinating relics from a bygone age.

The Ethometric Museum is an extraordinary collection of these obscure, yet compelling objects. Each machine, the precise purpose of which is unknown, creates specific harmonic frequencies, and when activated they combine together to create a rich sonic tapestry.
