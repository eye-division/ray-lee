Description:

Points of Departure, a major commission form Brighton Festival, was scheduled to be open to the public for ten days at Shoreham Port. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic it has been rescheduled for next year.

This is how it was described in the Brighton Festival brochure:

*World Premiere*

> ‘Mesmerizing’

*New Yorker Online on Ray Lee's work*

Against the backdrop of night, take a walk through the atmospheric industrial landscape of Shoreham Port and be dazzled by otherworldly sound and light installations. Wondrous machines emerge from the darkness to a strange but haunting effect - monumental kinetic sculptures that seemingly defy gravity as they spin and whirl in an endless dynamic dance.&nbsp;

In this one-of-a-kind event you are treated to a viewing of Ray Lee's spectacular sculptures, brought together for the first time. Towering metal tripods sing out a hypnotic siren call, while red lights whirl in mesmerising orbits of colour. A series of giant towers holding suspended speaker cones gradually swing higher and higher until each arm soars up over the heads of the audience - ringing with electronic tones that create a transfixing harmony of pulsing drones.&nbsp;

The structures sing an alien song, a sci-fi symphony that points to a future departure to other worlds and another universe.
