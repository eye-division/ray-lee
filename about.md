***Ray Lee*** is an award-winning sound artist and composer. He creates spinning, whirling, and pendulous sound installations and performances that explore “circles of ether,” the invisible forces that surround us. His immersive and mesmerising works such as the world-wide hit ***Siren***, **E*thometric Museum*** and his monumental outdoor work ***Chorus*** aim to make contemporary music accessible and engaging for a wide audience. ***Siren*** toured the world with significant British Council support. ***Ethometric Museum*** won him the 2012 British Composer of the Year for Sonic Art. ***Force Field*** was awarded an honorary mention in the 2008 Prix Ars Electronica. He is a Professor of Sound Art at Oxford Brookes University.
